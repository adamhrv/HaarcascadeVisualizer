This is a test for CV Dazzle's future github push.

Here's a visualizer I made that allows you to render the haarfeatures from the cascade files.

Notes:

1. You can change the cascade file in the top of the sketch

	String cascadeFile = "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml";

2. Clicking "Render first" will render only the first stage, a quick test.

3. Clicking "Render all" will render all stages. This can take while and is a good workout for your CPU. The files are saved into a folder within the sketch's directory, as .tif images.



* There is a more complete version of this that is animated, but it was made in Eclipse. It's part of the CV Dazzle code package and will be released later this year.

Thanks,
